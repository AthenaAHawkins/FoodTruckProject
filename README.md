# FoodTruckProject

#Description
This project was quite difficult for me. I felt like I struggled through it one method at a time but we did it! 

I started off writing my for loop and used that to iterate through the food truck information gatherer. From there, I decided to work on my methods and how to get the information from my constructors / getters and setters. This by far for me was the most challenging part. I had a semi grasp on how these function however when I started writing I realized that I was struggling with it a lot more than I thought. I worked with a fellow classmate and they were able to help provide some guidance and then we worked on the methods. These took us 6 hours to work through. But we did it! This was the best way for me to learn how everything worked together honestly. my methods work in similar ways to each other. They iterate through each food truck and if there's a field that returns null, will stop iterating. I struggled with how to get highest average to return the proper amount.

methods();
arrays[];
constructors();


#lessons learned
leave lots of time for coding and there's power in numbers. I was lucky to have someone to work on this class with to throw our heads together and work through the problems together.
